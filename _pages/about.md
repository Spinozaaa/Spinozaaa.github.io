Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a first-year PhD student in Information Science and Technology at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Lin Lu](https://louise-lulin.github.io). My research interest now lies in Federated Learning and trustworthy AI. 

Before that, I obtained my Mphil degree in Computer and Information Engineering from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) and B.S. degree in electronic information engineering, from Qiming College, [Hua Zhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/).
During the graduate study, I did research internship at [Alibaba Group](https://www.alibabagroup.com/en-US/).
